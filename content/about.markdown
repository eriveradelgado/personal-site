## Research

Developing a therapy takes an enormous amount of time and money with
some estimates fluctuating between [1.5 to 2.5 Billion USD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629616000291). I
am interested in creating and applying tools that reduce these costs and shorten 
their development time to increase therapy success rates. Among my research 
interests are:

1. Drug delivery PKPD
2. High-throughput screening 
3. Laboratory automation
4. Data science in the biopharmaceutical industry

## Vitae
Currently, I am a Scientist at [Vivtex](https://vivtex.com/team), a high
throughput drug formulation and drug delivery company in Cambridge, MA.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve 
University in the lab of [Horst von Recum](https://vonrecumlab.weebly.com). At 
Case, I specialized in the area of affinity-based drug delivery. You can find a 
list of my peer reviewed publications in [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OJCFVGAAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I completed my bachelors in the department of 
[Industrial Biotechnology](https://www.uprm.edu/biotech/) at the University of 
Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez.

Originally from [Juncos, Puerto Rico](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/regions/east/juncos#!grid~~~random~1).

## Life
 
In my free time I enjoy listening to 70's salsa and riding my bike.
