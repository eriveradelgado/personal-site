I obtained my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Case Western Reserve University. There, I specialized in the area of affinity-based drug delivery. You can find an automated list of my peer reviewed publications in [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OJCFVGAAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My goal with this blog is to document my scientific ideas in a way that others may find useful.

## Research Interests

My field of study is in the development strategies to deliver small molecules, proteins and cells. Currently it takes an enormous amount of time and money to develop new therapies with some estimates fluctuating between [1.5 to 2.5 Billion USD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629616000291). I am interested in learning and applying tools that reduce these costs and shorten the development time to bring new therapies to patients. Among my interest areas include:

1. Drug delivery PKPD
2. High-throughput screening 
3. Laboratory automation
4. Data science in the biopharmaceutical industry

## Personal Interests
 
In my free time I enjoy riding my bike around town to coffee shops and bakeries.
